 # Intuition
 Define a solution space to perform a binary search to find the max # of candies per pile
 
 # Approach
 Define a solution space of possible values.
 The minimum pile count has to be 1 since a pile cannot contain 0 candies.
 The maximum pile count is `max(candies)` since piles cannot be merged.
 Use a binary search to find the max pile count that satisfies `checkPiles`.
 
 # Complexity
 - Time complexity:
 O(n log n) where `n` is `candies.count`.
 O(n)(find max) * O(log n)(binary search) * O(n)(checkPiles)
 
 - Space complexity:
 O(1) only a few integers are stored.
 
 This problem is similar to to [875. Koko eating bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)
